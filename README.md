# React-Portfolio
Objective
Create a portfolio website that accurately represents your accomplishments, skill sets, and experience. This portfolio will be the first introduction between you and a prospective hiring manager. Hiring managers are looking for skill and professionalism, not irrelevant past experience, excessive personal content, goofy gifs, or anything that distracts them from your hireability. 

Use this opportunity to create a clean, attractive portfolio that you can use forever to showcase your abilities as a software engineer. Keep it direct and helpful. You are no longer a student - you’re a skilled developer showing off what you can do. 

Requirements
Create your own website set-up, no Wix or Squarespace!
Options: Jekyll, Gatsby, styleshout.com or from scratch in React
Every page completed, all links active
Add website link to each of your public channels (LinkedIn, GitHub)
Use appropriate spelling, grammar, capitalization
Include ALL content items listed below
Have completed website proofread - every inch - by at least one peer
Absolutely do NOT include: stock photos, ads, affiliate links, your bad mixtape, links to your personal social media accounts, political opinions, religious content, or any potentially offensive content
URL: firstnamelastname.com is ideal, get as close to that as you can (.me, .dev)
ALL student portfolios and Labs projects must have a domain name; no Netlify, GitHub, or other subdomain addresses.
 
We recommend you use www.namecheap.com. Once you purchase the domain name, you can follow one of these guides to get a custom domain name set up, depending on where you host your portfolio:
- Netlify - https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/
- Heroku - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains
- GitHub Pages - https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages
 
If you have concerns about the cost of purchasing your own domain, never fear! If needed, Lambda School can reimburse you. Get a picture or screenshot of the receipt and submit through Expensify, link here: https://join.my.expensify.com/?team=7B24693511C64F1D&thanks=amneet%40lambdaschool.com

DO NOT include your resume on your portfolio. Your resume should be individually tailored to any role, and you want to give people a reason to get in touch with you. If you give it all away at once, they might be less inclined to reach out.
